						<h2>Forum Background</h2>
						<p>
							As a global open source innovation platform, GOSIM has always adhered to the core spirit of open source — 
							with openness and inclusiveness as the foundation, global collaboration as the link, 
							and community-driven as the driving force. Based on this concept, the platform unites multiple forces 
							to jointly launch the AI Vision Forum, focusing on the key proposition of 
							"what core value can AI create for humanity".
						</p>

						<p>
							In recent years, large language models (LLM), generative AI and intelligent agents have rapidly iterated. 
							In areas of high intellectual tasks that were once exclusive to humans, from mathematical proofs and code writing 
							to literary writing and artistic creation, top AI models continue to break performance boundaries, 
							refreshing people's understanding of machine intelligence.
						</p>

						<blockquote>
							This breakthrough has stirred complex ripples in human society: on one hand, it seems that humans have found 
							the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe and opening the door to the next generation of civilization; 
							on the other hand, when AI continues to advance in the "human-exclusive" intellectual highlands, 
							people are also deeply worried: will human unique creativity and emotional perception be replaced?
						</blockquote>

						<h2>Forum Objectives</h2>
						<p>
							Around these questions, this AI Vision Forum jointly initiated by GOSIM and the Sino-French Artificial Intelligence Association 
							brings together representatives from top universities, research institutions and enterprises worldwide, 
							adopting an invitation-only, non-public, small-scale deep interaction mechanism.
						</p>

						<p>
							The forum particularly focuses on the positive value of artificial intelligence in the human experience dimension, 
							focusing on key areas such as educational innovation, cultural creation, emotional companionship, 
							and technological equity, and deeply explores the deep proposition of how AI products balance 
							functionality and ethics, efficiency and warmth in practical applications.
						</p>

						<h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
						<p>
							We advocate a paradigm leap from "tool enabling" to "value-oriented" — making AI not only a technical empowerment tool, 
							but also result-oriented, effectively responding to and solving core human concerns.
						</p>

						<p>
							In activity design, the forum specially sets up the "Technical Products" and "Artistic Creativity" dual-unit 
							AIGC Spotlight global work display, aiming to build a community of thought that spans technical logic and humanistic perspectives.
						</p>

						<h2>International Collaboration</h2>
						<p>
							This event is not only a cross-border deep dialogue, but also an important practice for China and Europe 
							to reshape consensus on AI social responsibility and value orientation, committed to creating an international 
							cooperation platform with continuity, influence and ethical thinking tension.
